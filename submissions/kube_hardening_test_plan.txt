How test the changes?
Either test or stage environments first and make sure the environment mirroring as production environment in all components, lib. software, etc in instillation or version as same to make sure there will no be differences or chance of wrong results for the test, then test the the system by implementing test scenarios in both application and cluster, application level by login, create new record, etc and for cluster level, by creating new containers, clusters, nodes, remove or delete,  moreover we can do a canary test or smoke test by forwarding some traffic to test environment for validation and watch the system behavior, all the steps require to be documented, once confirm everything is right then implement the same production environment.

How ensure the changes don't negatively affect cluster?
By checking the cluster, pods, service status and switch between clusters to make sure the fail-over mechanism working as expect with no failures, moreover check and trace the logs for any warning, errors or failure happened and check the response time of the services in observability and monitoring and may we can checking the utilization of the resources also during, before and after implementing test scenarios. we can build a new application as a test then pass it to CI/CD to validation the life cycle of cluster
