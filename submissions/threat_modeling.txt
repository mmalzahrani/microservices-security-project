Docker Threat Modeling
- Spoofing:
  - Weak in Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  - Network traffic isn't restricted between containers on the default bridge
- Repudiation:
  - Build an image wrongly with no --no-cache=true
- Elevation of Privilege
  - Build an image wrongly like -pravlaged
- Denial of Service:
  - Userland Proxy isn't Disabled
- Elevation of Privilege
  - Files with wrong permission vulnerable to manipulation

Kubernetes Threat Modeling
- Spoofing:
  - Weak in Transport Layer Security (TLS) in API calls
- Repudiation:
  - Trusted authorized not configured in API level which mean there is ability to manipulate API via unauthorized
- Tampering
  - etcd files with wrong permission and the owner is the root
- Denial of Service:
  - As long there is no TLS which mean the data will be leaked
- Elevation of Privilege
  - Files with wrong permission vulnerable to manipulation

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
